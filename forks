polestar.com.kp
futurere.com.kp
samhae.com.kp

these three open up copies of the cooks.org.kp website

searching for their names (or searching "site:naenara.com.kp/sites") brings up a lot of business/fund sites
many of the ones showing up in searches are just different, now-unused urls for many of the same sites

such as 
naenara.com.kp/sites/polestar/
naenara.com.kp/sites/refuture/
naenara.com.kp/sites/unjong/
naenara.com.kp/sites/samhae/
naenara.com.kp/sites/rainbow/
naenara.com.kp/sites/kgf/
www.naenara.com.kp/sites/kfpd/
naenara.com.kp/sites/kkf/
www.naenara.com.kp/sites/national/
